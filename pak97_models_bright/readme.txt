MD2 model overrides

https://skuller.net/q2pro/nightly/client.html

When Q2PRO attempts to load an alias model from disk, it determines actual model format by file contents, 
rather than by filename extension. Therefore, if you wish to override MD2 model with MD3 replacement, 
simply rename the MD3 model to ‘tris.md2’ and place it in appropriate packfile to make sure it gets loaded first.

ALL files are md3, but renamed to md2!!!
